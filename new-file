as per POST request body I had got from swagger for public/org/{org_id}/segment

filters have conditions in like  
"conditions": [
        {
          "operator": "<",
          "value": 0,
          "context": "string"
        }
      ],
      "context": "string"

serializer though is not taking any context as an input parameter, this leads to http 500

when post of put method is used on this api. This is why I've added context here.
